/*Create a class named Sandwich. Include a Bread field and a SandwichFilling
field. Include a constructor that takes parameters for each field needed in the two
objects and assigns them to each objectâ€™s constructor.Write an application
named TestSandwich to instantiate three Sandwich objects with different values,
and then display all the data for each object, including the total calories in a
Sandwich, assuming that each Sandwich is made using two slices of Bread. Save
both the Sandwich.java and TestSandwich.java files.*/
